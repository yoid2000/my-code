1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,280
Thank you for the meal. (Sword) Thank you very much.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,370
(Anna) Thank you very much. please. yes.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,530
The B lunch and set cake will cost 1,000 yen...

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,930
that! yes?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,920
I've been meaning to say this for a while, but... eh?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,650
Sister, you're beautiful.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,190
Makeup, hairstyle, etc... I always refer to it!

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,560
Ah….

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,090
Thank you for the meal. Ah. I'll come back later.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,090
thank you.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:44,240
(humming)

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,590
what up?

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,290
A girl would be happy if someone told her she was beautiful.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,660
It gives me confidence. Yeah?

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,360
Ah, I hope Tsurugi-san also told me!

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,060
I like your hair, you look beautiful, etc.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,750
Tsurugi-san: I'm the type who doesn't say unnecessary things.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,770
What you think about me sometimes

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,770
Even if you tell me straight...

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,210
eh?

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,230
wait a minute.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,440
What do you have?

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,810
Eh, what should I do? Eh, no...

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,810
I'm still mentally prepared...

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,890
let's go. It's a delivery.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,430
eh?

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right. It's a request, isn't it? Hehe...

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,700
Don't think of strange things.

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,060
But was anyone coming?

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,920
Before.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Like a week ago?

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
One year ago.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Hayasaka: I want this to be delivered to a woman named Mitsuki.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,420
Could you please check inside?

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Oh, of course.

36
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,530
It is nice.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,800
What should we do about the date and time?

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,510
Can you do that in one year?

39
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,210
Ah...of course.

40
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,590
Well next year

41
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,620
February 24th

42
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,330
At 3pm.

43
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,520
Wear a white coat as a sign

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll tell her

45
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,610
There are also requests like that.

46
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,150
A year later, it will be my first time too.

47
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,360
But why don't you give it yourself?

48
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,390
Because this is a proposal, right?

49
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,390
I wonder what Mitsuki will think when we give it to her.

50
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,010
I know this park. It's near my house.

51
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,010
Really. Yeah.

52
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,110
it is? Yeah. from the client

53
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,110
He asked me to buy 33 roses.

54
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,050
Eh... it's no good after all.

55
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,750
I have to give this to you!

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,440
I can't believe I'm going to receive it from Mr. Tsurugi instead.

57
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,460
If it were me, I would definitely hate it!

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll be confused for the rest of my life!

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,500
Nothing to die for!

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Ha... And 33 pieces.

61
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,890
It's kind of half-hearted...

62
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,890
Maybe 100 pieces...

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,250
Mr. Tsurugi...

64
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,860
I... I understand.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Yeah?

66
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,370
Mr. Mitsuki.

67
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,370
This is from Mitsuo Hayasaka.

68
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,130
I came to deliver it on his behalf.

69
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,830
Ami-chan.

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,850
Congratulations.

71
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,870
happy!

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,410
thank you!

73
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,280
is that so. Mr. Hayasaka

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
You won't come by yourself

75
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Why not give it yourself?

76
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,760
A mediocre number of roses. this is

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
It's a flash mob!

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
～

79
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,800
Something like 33 pieces.

80
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I can't convey my love.

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Please marry me.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,020
yes

83
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:13,220
～

84
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,750
Fufufu… Ahaha….

85
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,950
Ahaha... Mr. Tsurugi

86
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,980
Please don't dance.

87
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,840
It's so interesting that I decided to watch it.

88
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Hahaha….

89
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,790
(humming)

90
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Mitsuki-san, are you here yet?

91
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,830
It makes us all excited.

92
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,900
Mr. Mitsuki. This is from Mitsuo Hayasaka.

93
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
I came to deliver it on his behalf.

94
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
that?

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
that? It won't start.

96
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,200
What about Mitsuo Hayasaka? that?

97
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,420
(Mitsuki) Mitsuo Hayasaka will not be coming.

98
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Huh? Why? This is a proposal, right?

99
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's not that they don't come, but that they're here... right?

100
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,030
It's been a while, Courier.

101
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,030
I was looking forward to meeting you.

102
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,910
What do you mean?

103
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,490
Mitsuo Hayasaka is

104
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,490
This is me a year ago.

105
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,730
eh?

106
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,250
It has changed.

107
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,110
Gender too

108
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,140
Even the name.

109
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
that's….

110
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,850
I had surgery.

111
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,750
So this is...

112
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,660
I gave it to myself.

113
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,360
Can I take it?

114
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
yes.

115
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,050
like a dream.

116
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
It fits you well.

117
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm so glad I took the plunge

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,740
I think so.

119
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,770
Be the person you like

120
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,770
Because I got used to it.

121
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
This is the letter and rose that I kept for you.

122
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,780
It's definitely a confession of love...

123
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,670
It's love for yourself.

124
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,470
I thought no one would celebrate.

125
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,680
I thought I should at least tell myself

126
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,050
I gave it to you.

127
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,760
Can I ask you one more thing?

128
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,460
what do you want? Preferably on the day

129
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I would also like you to send me a bouquet of flowers.

130
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,890
With 33 roses

131
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,890
Along with the language of flowers

132
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
"I'll still love you even if I'm born again."

133
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,370
Thank you for delivering it so well.

134
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
What happened?

135
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,950
this park

136
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,950
I remember coming here often with my mother.

137
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,230
I haven't seen you for a while.

138
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,230
My family wouldn't forgive me.

139
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Sometimes I think I should go see him.

140
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,920
But look at it like this

141
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
I understand it painfully.

142
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,010
Those who don't understand

143
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,010
They say they don't understand.

144
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,270
What hurts is

145
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,270
Because it's scary.

146
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,750
Well, someday... I guess.

147
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,750
That day may never come.

148
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,900
Thank you so much...

149
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,590
let's go!

150
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,590
eh.

151
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,020
Let me see what it looks like now.

152
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,880
but….

153
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I want to meet you, right?

154
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,150
We should definitely meet.

155
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,360
Why…. Because it's beautiful!

156
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Soooo!

157
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,120
Beautiful Mitsuki

158
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,520
You should definitely see it.

159
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,450
I wasn't really surprised.

160
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,290
Did you know?

161
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,990
The ring you gave me is size 16.

162
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,870
It looked like about 18mm. just

163
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,070
It's the size of someone around Hayasaka's size.

164
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,430
Until that point...

165
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,430
Tsurugi-san, I see too much.

166
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,690
The reason after one year: The meaning of the language of flowers.

167
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,550
Above all, if you just give it to your lover

168
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,910
Don't ask us.

169
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,910
That's right.

170
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,360
Now, please sign for receipt.

171
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
yes.

172
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,530
Hayasaka: To me one year from now. How are you.

173
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,720
I really want to convey my feelings right now

174
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,090
I'll send you this letter.

175
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,460
What do you think of the ring?

176
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,320
Does it suit you?

177
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,360
I feel like I look like myself

178
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
how is it?

179
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,600
(Hayasaka) What are your feelings as you read this?

180
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I can kind of guess it.

181
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,670
(Hayasaka) It's strange to say it myself, but

182
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,370
Congratulations.

183
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,580
I'm sure you have a lot of courage

184
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,580
You should be able to overcome many trials.

185
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,500
(Hayasaka) I don't know what anyone will say, but

186
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,710
You are my admiration now

187
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,580
I'm proud.

188
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,100
Just don't forget that.

189
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Please live your life with pride.

190
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,030
(Hayasaka) You who showed courage

191
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,220
from the heart

192
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
I hope you keep smiling

193
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,360
Ah. please look.

194
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
full moon.

195
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,420
It's beautiful.

196
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
(Yumi) Shall I make some coffee?

197
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Mitsuo also drinks...

198
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
(Yumi) What's your name?

199
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,130
I changed it.

200
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,130
yes.

201
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,670
I have to take in the laundry...

202
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,310
Shall we go home soon?

203
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,310
Yeah!

204
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,230
Ah, perfectly round!

205
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,280
It's true. It's a full moon.

206
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,640
You know, when Mitsuo was born too.

207
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,670
The moon was like that. Is that so?

208
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,030
Therefore, ``Mitsuo''.

209
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,070
A boy as big and dignified as the full moon

210
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,070
I hope it will be.

211
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,490
If it were a girl, I wanted her name to be ``Mizuki.''

212
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,010
Beautiful like a full moon

213
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,880
I want you to become a dignified girl.

214
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,750
That's so cute? Yeah. cute!

215
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:41,130
～

216
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,130
Mitsuki?

217
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,190
eh.

218
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:57,290
～

219
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,150
Yeah.

220
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,510
Mitsuki...

221
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:15,510
～

222
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,690
Mitsuki-san, are you okay?

223
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,930
why her

224
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,460
Were you thinking of delivering it to your family?

225
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,340
eh? Because I thought we should meet.

226
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,060
I... I can't think of difficult things like Mr. Tsurugi.

227
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,100
Because that's what I honestly thought.

228
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,130
Really.

229
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,820
in addition

230
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,520
Isn't it hard?

231
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I can't see my family.

232
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,340
here you are. what? Today is.

233
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,020
Tsukimi omelette curry.

234
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,220
I made it with the image of a full moon.

235
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Yeah. Hehe….

236
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,660
Mmm, delicious.

237
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Ah.

238
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
By the way, I have a story.

239
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,280
eh.

240
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
Eh, eh….

241
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,500
what is it?

242
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Always helpful. I look forward to your continued support.

243
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,110
yes? No, sometimes

244
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,630
I want you to tell me straight what you're thinking.

245
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,840
Because I said it, I said it.

246
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,530
Mr. Tsurugi

247
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,570
Are you going to the hospital? We are open for night emergencies.

248
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,930
Then cancel it. Ah, no, no, no….

249
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,930
I can't undo it now. I saved it in my brain.

250
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,490
Ah.

251
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,070
Even Ken-san couldn't deliver it.

252
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,070
Is there one?

253
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,940
I was wondering if there was one...

254
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,880
How many times? Oh, she is like that.

255
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
I just asked!

256
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Really.

257
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,900
Liar.

258
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,430
I said I would deliver it...
