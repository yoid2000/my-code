1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,280
Thank -- for the meal. (Sword) Thank -- very much.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,370
(Anna) Thank -- very much. please. yes.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,530
The B lunch and set cake will cost 1,000 yen...

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,930
that! yes?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,920
--'ve been meaning to say this for a while, but... eh?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,650
Sister, -- beautiful.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,190
Makeup, hairstyle, etc... -- always refer to it!

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,560
Ah….

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,090
Thank -- for the meal. Ah. --'ll come back later.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,090
thank --.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:44,240
(humming)

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,590
what up?

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,290
A girl would be happy if someone told -- -- was beautiful.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,660
It gives -- confidence. Yeah?

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,360
Ah, -- hope Tsurugi-san also told --!

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,060
-- like -- hair, -- look beautiful, etc.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,750
Tsurugi-san: -- the type who doesn't say unnecessary things.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,770
What -- think about -- sometimes

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,770
Even if -- tell -- straight...

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,210
eh?

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,230
wait a minute.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,440
What do -- have?

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,810
Eh, what should -- do? Eh, no...

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,810
-- still mentally prepared...

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,890
let's go. It's a delivery.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,430
eh?

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right. It's a request, isn't it? Hehe...

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,700
Don't think of strange things.

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,060
But was anyone coming?

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,920
Before.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Like a week ago?

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
One year ago.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Hayasaka: -- want this to be delivered to a woman named Mitsuki.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,420
Could -- please check inside?

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Oh, of course.

36
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,530
It is nice.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,800
What should -- do about the date and time?

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,510
Can -- do that in one year?

39
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,210
Ah...of course.

40
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,590
Well next year

41
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,620
February 24th

42
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,330
At 3pm.

43
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,520
Wear a white coat as a sign

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
--'ll tell --

45
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,610
There are also requests like that.

46
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,150
A year later, it will be -- first time too.

47
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,360
But why don't -- give it --?

48
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,390
Because this is a proposal, right?

49
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,390
-- wonder what Mitsuki will think when -- give it to --.

50
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,010
-- know this park. It's near -- house.

51
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,010
Really. Yeah.

52
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,110
it is? Yeah. from the client

53
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,110
-- asked -- to buy 33 roses.

54
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,050
Eh... it's no good after all.

55
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,750
-- have to give this to --!

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,440
-- can't believe -- going to receive it from Mr. Tsurugi instead.

57
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,460
If it were --, -- would definitely hate it!

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,480
--'ll be confused for the rest of -- life!

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,500
Nothing to die for!

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Ha... And 33 pieces.

61
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,890
It's kind of half-hearted...

62
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,890
Maybe 100 pieces...

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,250
Mr. Tsurugi...

64
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,860
--... -- understand.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Yeah?

66
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,370
Mr. Mitsuki.

67
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,370
This is from Mitsuo Hayasaka.

68
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,130
-- came to deliver it on -- behalf.

69
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,830
Ami-chan.

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,850
Congratulations.

71
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,870
happy!

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,410
thank --!

73
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,280
is that so. Mr. Hayasaka

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
-- won't come by --

75
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Why not give it --?

76
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,760
A mediocre number of roses. this is

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
It's a flash mob!

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
～

79
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,800
Something like 33 pieces.

80
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
-- can't convey -- love.

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Please marry --.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,020
yes

83
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:13,220
～

84
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,750
Fufufu… Ahaha….

85
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,950
Ahaha... Mr. Tsurugi

86
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,980
Please don't dance.

87
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,840
It's so interesting that -- decided to watch it.

88
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Hahaha….

89
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,790
(humming)

90
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Mitsuki-san, are -- here yet?

91
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,830
It makes -- all excited.

92
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,900
Mr. Mitsuki. This is from Mitsuo Hayasaka.

93
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
-- came to deliver it on -- behalf.

94
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
that?

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
that? It won't start.

96
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,200
What about Mitsuo Hayasaka? that?

97
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,420
(Mitsuki) Mitsuo Hayasaka will not be coming.

98
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Huh? Why? This is a proposal, right?

99
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's not that they don't come, but that they're here... right?

100
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,030
It's been a while, Courier.

101
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,030
-- was looking forward to meeting --.

102
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,910
What do -- mean?

103
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,490
Mitsuo Hayasaka is

104
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,490
This is -- a year ago.

105
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,730
eh?

106
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,250
It has changed.

107
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,110
Gender too

108
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,140
Even the name.

109
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
that's….

110
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,850
-- had surgery.

111
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,750
So this is...

112
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,660
-- gave it to --.

113
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,360
Can -- take it?

114
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
yes.

115
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,050
like a dream.

116
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
It fits -- well.

117
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,200
-- so glad -- took the plunge

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,740
-- think so.

119
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,770
Be the person -- like

120
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,770
Because -- got used to it.

121
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
This is the letter and rose that -- kept for --.

122
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,780
It's definitely a confession of love...

123
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,670
It's love for --.

124
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,470
-- thought no one would celebrate.

125
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,680
-- thought -- should at least tell --

126
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,050
-- gave it to --.

127
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,760
Can -- ask -- one more thing?

128
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,460
what do -- want? Preferably on the day

129
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
-- would also like -- to send -- a bouquet of flowers.

130
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,890
With 33 roses

131
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,890
Along with the language of flowers

132
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
"--'ll still love -- even if -- born again."

133
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,370
Thank -- for delivering it so well.

134
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
What happened?

135
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,950
this park

136
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,950
-- remember coming here often with -- mother.

137
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,230
-- haven't seen -- for a while.

138
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,230
-- family wouldn't forgive --.

139
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Sometimes -- think -- should go see --.

140
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,920
But look at it like this

141
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
-- understand it painfully.

142
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,010
Those who don't understand

143
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,010
They say they don't understand.

144
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,270
What hurts is

145
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,270
Because it's scary.

146
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,750
Well, someday... -- guess.

147
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,750
That day may never come.

148
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,900
Thank -- so much...

149
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,590
let's go!

150
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,590
eh.

151
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,020
Let -- see what it looks like now.

152
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,880
but….

153
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
-- want to meet --, right?

154
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,150
-- should definitely meet.

155
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,360
Why…. Because it's beautiful!

156
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Soooo!

157
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,120
Beautiful Mitsuki

158
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,520
-- should definitely see it.

159
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,450
-- wasn't really surprised.

160
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,290
Did -- know?

161
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,990
The ring -- gave -- is size 16.

162
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,870
It looked like about 18mm. just

163
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,070
It's the size of someone around Hayasaka's size.

164
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,430
Until that point...

165
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,430
Tsurugi-san, -- see too much.

166
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,690
The reason after one year: The meaning of the language of flowers.

167
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,550
Above all, if -- just give it to -- lover

168
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,910
Don't ask --.

169
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,910
That's right.

170
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,360
Now, please sign for receipt.

171
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
yes.

172
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,530
Hayasaka: To -- one year from now. How are --.

173
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,720
-- really want to convey -- feelings right now

174
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,090
--'ll send -- this letter.

175
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,460
What do -- think of the ring?

176
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,320
Does it suit --?

177
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,360
-- feel like -- look like --

178
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
how is it?

179
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,600
(Hayasaka) What are -- feelings as -- read this?

180
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
-- can kind of guess it.

181
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,670
(Hayasaka) It's strange to say it --, but

182
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,370
Congratulations.

183
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,580
-- sure -- have a lot of courage

184
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,580
-- should be able to overcome many trials.

185
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,500
(Hayasaka) -- don't know what anyone will say, but

186
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,710
-- are -- admiration now

187
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,580

-- know, when Mitsuo was born too.

207

The moon was like that. Is that so?

Therefore, ``Mitsuo''.

209
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,070
A boy as big and dignified as the full moon

226
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,060
--... -- can't think of difficult things like Mr. Tsurugi.

227
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,100
Because that's what -- honestly thought.

228
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,130
Really.

229
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,820
in addition

230
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,520
Isn't it hard?

231
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
-- can't see -- family.

232
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,340

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,630
-- want -- to tell -- straight what -- thinking.

245
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,840

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,490
Ah.

251
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,070
Even Ken-san couldn't deliver it.

252
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,070
Is there one?

253
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,940
-- was wondering if there was one...

254
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,880
